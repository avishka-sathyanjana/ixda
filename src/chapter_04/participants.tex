\section{Participant Selection}
\label{sec:participant-selection}
For this research, we selected 10 participants using a quota sampling method combined with convenience sampling. The participants were handpicked, but not based on expert knowledge. The aim was to make sure there was a balanced representation in terms of gender, background, and age.

Out of the 10 participants, there were 6 males and 4 females. From a background point of view, 6 were from technical fields while 4 were from non-technical backgrounds. Age-wise, 2 participants were from the 15–20 age group, 5 were in the 24–26 range, and 2 were aged between 50–60.

This method helped to analyze differences in emotional expression and recognition based on these demographic factors. All participants took part with informed consent. The consent form used for this purpose is available in the Appendix (see Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-consent}).
