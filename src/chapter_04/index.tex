\par This chapter presents the evaluation and results for the experiments that were discussed in Section~\ref{sec:methodology-overview}. It also addresses the research objectives mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:research-questions-objectives}. Chapter begins with Section~\ref{sec:participant-selection}, which explains the process of selecting participants for the study. The following sections, from Section~\ref{sec:res-phase1} to Section~\ref{sec:baseline-refinement}, present detailed evaluations of each phase of the methodology. These include selecting suitable emotion recognition models, implementing the personalized multimodal fusion approach, identifying the emotional baseline, integrating emotional context into LLM responses, and refining the baseline using reinforcement learning. Each phase is evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative feedback from participants to assess how well the system addresses the defined research objectives.
